  ip          = "${join(",", data.dns_a_record_set.rds.addrs)}" // I received the IP address from a DNS RDS database in AWS, but can also be a plain IP address.
  attributes = {
    Environment  = "test"
    Datacenter   = "aws"
    app_name     = "opencart"
    Scope        = "vpc-0d078cb997c1b563d"
